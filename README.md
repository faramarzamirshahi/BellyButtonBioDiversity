# BellyButtonBioDiversity
Rosa is a prominent researcher in a prominent biologic laboratory. Rosa's role is to discover and document new bacteria species, in particular is she is interested in bacteria species that can synthetize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab is partnered with "Improbable Beef" a food startup to research candidate species.<br>
Labs acroos the country have had success to synthetize meat from algaes, funghi and micro-organisms found in  plant roots.<br>
However "Improbabale Beef" is still searching for elusive bacteria that provide the perfect taste.<br>
Rosa has a hypothesis that there is a micro-organism that can supply the next best taste, and she believes that it can be found quite close to home, from bacteria found on the human body. Here is what she know so-far. The human body is the source of thousands of bacteria and different parts of the body harbour different species.<br>
and between individuals the bacteria may vary even in the same location.<br>
Rosa hypothesises that the perfect bacteria species that can be used to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button, or at least in someone's belly button.<br>
To test her hypothesis, Rosa has sampled navels from people across the country to identify bacteria species that colonize our belly button. Each person's identity is anonymous, instead they have been instead been assigned an id number.<br>
Rosa wants to build a dashboard that both the research participants and fellow researchers can access.<br>
Those who participated in the study can visit a web-site and select their id numbers to see which bacteria species live in their navels.<br>
